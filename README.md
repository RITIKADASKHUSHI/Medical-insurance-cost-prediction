# Medical-insurance-cost-prediction
As a vast population invests in health insurance, it is hard to keep track of trends. The ineffective analysis of data results in cost overruns and insurance inequity, making its access difficult. There is a need to critically analyze the insurance data and make an insurance policy that is well adapted to the geographical and financial statuses of the insurers. 

It is therefore very critical to carry out these tasks with high accuracy. So, the possibility of human mistakes are high so insurance agents also use different tools to calculate the insurance premium. And thus ML is beneficial here. ML may generalize the effort or method to formulate the policy. These ML models can be learned by themselves. The model is trained on insurance data from the past. The model can then accurately predict insurance policy costs by using the necessary elements to measure the payments as its inputs. This decreases human effort and resources and improves the companyâ€™s profitability.

In simple words, our goal was to build a predictive system which can predict the medical insurance cost of a person.

So in this project, the objective of the proposed model was to perform rapid estimation and prediction of insurance charges at a hospital incurred by a patient, using ML models upon the Kaggle dataset. The proposed model incorporates and demonstrates different regression models such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, SVM and Xgboost to predict the insurance costs and compares the models based on their results.
